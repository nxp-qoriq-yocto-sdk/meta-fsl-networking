This package contains firmware required by the Vitesse VSC7385 Gigabit Switch
device on the MPC8313ERDB board.  The firmware is stored as a binary image in the
file called "vsc2bin".  The firmware is loaded to the VSC7385 device that 
contains a standalone processor.  The VSC7385 firmware runs independently of
the main processor subsystem and software within the MPC8313ERDB board.
Once loaded and started the VSC7385 has no interaction with the software
system from which it was loaded.
